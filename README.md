XenForoAdminExtras
==================
This add-on adds an additional template called EXTRA.css and an extra.js file to the admin side of the site only.

The purpose being to add customization to the admin without modifying the core admin templates.

Install like any other add-on; upload the files to the correct directories and import the xml.

There's one additional option which allows you to increment the cache buster on the files.

Thanks goes out to Naatan and his resource Template Syntax as this Listener is based on that one.
